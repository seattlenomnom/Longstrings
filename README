/* readme for longstrings;
*     longstrings practices declaring/defining long strings. It will also
*  experiment with using universal characters.
*     This is an example program from Kochan, Stephen G., "Programming in C
*  3rd ed.", Sams Publishing. Actually not an example, a program designed and
*  written by me to experiment with long strings and universal characters.

*  Programmer: Mark Crapser.
